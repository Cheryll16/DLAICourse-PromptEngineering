# DLAICourse-PromptEngineering

This repository collects my note and exercises during the online DeepLearning.AI online course [Prompt Engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers).

The code in this repository is only executable if you:
(1) Have an own OpenAI account and get your own API key.
(2) Not yet hit your RateLimit. But I personally also encountered the problem of rate limit error even though I am not reaching my limit.

Possible Troubleshooting:
(1) [OpenAI API Error Codes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes)
(2) [OpenAI Developer Platform](https://community.openai.com/)
